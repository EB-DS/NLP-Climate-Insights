# AI-Powered Climate Policy Analyzer 
## Analyze climate policies using NLP and LLMs

### Overview
Climate policy is a critical global issue, with numerous organizations publishing policies aimed at mitigating climate change, adapting to its effects, and achieving sustainability goals. However, navigating and understanding these policies can be complex due to their varied structures, terminologies, and formats.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the analysis of climate policies from multiple organizations. Using state-of-the-art AI-driven.
